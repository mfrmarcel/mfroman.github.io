<p> Marcel Roman is a Provost's Early Career Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas-Austin in the Government Department and a research fellow at the Latino Politics and Policy Initiative (LPPI) </p>

<p> His dissertation project examines how an increasingly restrictive immigration enforcement environment motivates progressive political commitments among Latinxs despite countervailing conservative forces. His [job market paper](pdfs/wps/deportation_threat.pdf) challenges canonical theories of immigrant assimilation and provides evidence threatening immigration enforcement contexts forestall political assimilation with Anglo whites among Latinxs. His research has been published in <i> Political Research Quarterly </i>, <i> Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics </i> and the <i> UCLA Law Review. </i> </p>

<p> He has also served as an expert consultant on multiple lawsuits related to immigrant rights and immigrant incorporation including <i> New York vs. ICE </i> and <i> New York vs. United States Department of Commerce. </i> </p>
