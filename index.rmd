Marcel Roman is a PhD candidate in political science at the University of California-Los Angeles specializing in Race and Ethnic Politics (REP). His dissertation project examines how an increasingly restrictive immigration enforcement environment over the past 30 years motivates and maintains progressive political commitments among Latinx communities despite countervailing conservative forces. His [job market paper](pdfs/wps/deportation_threat.pdf) challenges canonical theories of immigrant acculturation and provides evidence threatening immigration enforcement contexts forestall attitudinal assimilation with Anglo whites among Latinxs.  His research has been published in the <i> Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics </i> and the <i> UCLA Law Review </i>
