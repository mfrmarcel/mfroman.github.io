<p> Marcel Roman is a PhD candidate in political science at the University of California-Los Angeles specializing in Race and Ethnic Politics (REP) and a research fellow at the Latino Politics and Policy Initiative (LPPI). In the Fall of 2021, he will start a postdoctoral position as a Provost's Early Career Fellow at the University of Texas-Austin in the Government Department </p>

<p> His dissertation project examines how an increasingly restrictive immigration enforcement environment over the past 30 years motivates and maintains progressive political commitments among Latinx communities despite countervailing conservative forces. His [job market paper](pdfs/wps/deportation_threat.pdf) challenges canonical theories of immigrant acculturation and provides evidence threatening immigration enforcement contexts forestall attitudinal assimilation with Anglo whites among Latinxs.  His research has been published in the <i> Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics </i> and the <i> UCLA Law Review. </i> </p>

<p> He has also served as an expert consultant on multiple lawsuits related to immigrant rights and immigrant incorporation including <i> New York vs. ICE </i> and <i> New York vs. United States Department of Commerce. </i> </p>
