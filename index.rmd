<p> I am a Provost's Early Career Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas-Austin Government department and a research fellow at the Latino Politics and Policy Initiative (LPPI). In Fall 2023, I will be a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's Government Department before starting an assistant professor position in Fall 2024. My research focuses on Race and Ethnic Politics in the United States, with an emphasis on Latinx politics, immigration, and policing. I received my PhD in political science from the University of California-Los Angeles.</p>

<p> My book project, <i> In the Shadow of Deportation: How Immigration Enforcement Shapes The Politics of Latinx Communities </i>, examines how an increasingly restrictive immigration context motivates progressive political commitments among Latinxs despite countervailing conservative predispositions and assimilative pressure to adopt Anglo white political norms. The book project uses 17 representative Latinx surveys from 2007-2021 (N = 34,000), survey experiments, large tracking polls, and plausibly causal research designs to challenge canonical theories of immigrant assimilation and provide evidence threatening immigration enforcement contexts forestall political assimilation with Anglo whites among Latinxs along multiple dimensions. </p>

My research has been published in <i> Political Research Quarterly </i>; <i> Political Behavior </i>; the <i> Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics; </i> and the <i> UCLA Law Review. </i> </p>

<p> I have also served as an expert consultant on multiple lawsuits related to immigrant rights and immigrant incorporation including <i> New York vs. ICE </i> and <i> New York vs. United States Department of Commerce. </i> </p>
